This project focuses on VLAN configuration in a Cisco networking environment by introducing multiple VLANs with unique IP addressing. A router is added to enable inter-VLAN communication using sub-interfaces. This setup demonstrates how VLANs can create multiple isolated networks on a single switch while maintaining efficient routing.
